# Flight_delays
 
 This is a midterm project for LighthouseLabs that predicts flight delays

 It uses supervised learning based on the following flight data:
>   *   flights (Departure and arrival information for US flights from 2018-2019)
>   *   fuel_consumption (Consumption of different airlines 2015-2019 aggregated per month)
>   * passengers (Total passengers on different routes from 2015-2019 aggregated per month)
>   * flights_test (Departure and arrival information test data set)
